# Old projects

This is a repository where I keep all my old scripts, prototypes and projects that I made when I was learning to program and I wouldn't use Git or GitHub. Most of them are made with Python, but there are also some Godot (3.3) games and a Unity game.

No more games will be added because they'll have their own repository.

Please note that most of the **the code here is bad code and some things have stopped working**.

## Python

I mostly used Python 3.7, and some of the Python packages I used are:

- Pygame
- Tkinter
- Requests, lxml and BeautifulSoup
- Kivy
- Numpy

Therefore, if you want to run a script, you must first look at the packages it uses and install them via `pip install <package name>`.
