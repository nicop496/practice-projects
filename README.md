# Practice projects
This is a repository where I keep all my old scripts, prototypes and projects that I made when I was learning to program. 

They are all made with Python because it was my first language and I don't want to include other projects that I have made with Godot, for example. Also, it's this and I won't include more, since my next projects will have more purpose to exist, or at least they will deserve their own repository. That's a good reason why this is (almost) the only README file you'll find here. 

Please note that most of the **the code here is bad code and some things have stopped working**.

Some of the packages I used are:
- Pygame
- Tkinter
- Requests, lxml and BeautifulSoup
- Kivy
- Numpy

Therefore, if you want to run a script, you must first look at the packages it uses and install them via `pip install <package name>`.
