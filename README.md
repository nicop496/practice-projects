# Practice projects
This is a repository where I keep all my old scripts, prototypes and projects that I did when I was learning to program. 

They are all made with Python because it was my first language and I didn't want to include other projects that I did for example with Godot. Also, it's this and I won't include more, since my next projects will have more purpose to exist, or at least they will deserve their own repository. That's a good reason why this is the only readme you'll find here (with a few exceptions). Please note that the code here is bad code and some things have probably stopped working.

Some of the packages I used are:
- Pygame
- Tkinter
- Requests, lxml and BeautifulSoup
- Kivy
- Numpy
  
therefore, if you want to run a script, you must first look at the packages it uses and install them via PIP.
